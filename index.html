                        <h4>The Start</h4>
                        ZZPerformance started in Zoom's very own garage back
                        in
                        2000. He had made an important investment in a vehicle that would change the course of his life,
                        a
                        Pontiac Grand Prix. After much frustration with finding parts from other aftermarket performance
                        companies, he saw an opportunity to make changes to the way businesses operated in this market.
                        No
                        longer would individuals be tricked or misled. With this mindset Zoom began building
                        ZZPerformance
                        from the ground up.

                        was
                        followed by huge success. Word spread quickly around the forums and business exploded.
                        ZZPerformance
                        made the move from Zoom's garage to their first building on Division Street in Grand Rapids, MI.

                    After 4 short years, ZZP became the world's largest
                    supplier of aftermarket performance parts for 3800. As one of the most-produced engines in history,
                    ZZPerformance’s growth gained heavy traction and began to expand its markets.

                    ZZPerformance recognized the need to expand and after much
                    consideration added the Ecotec Engine to the mix. The ZZP team began their research and development
                    on the Ecotec platform with the same vigor and drive as they had brought to the 3800 platform, with
                    the hopes of dominating the market.
